## Getting Started

To start using ALPHA-OS for prosthetic development, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the ALPHA-OS repository to your local machine using Git.

    ```bash
    git clone https:ithub.com/your-username/alpha-os.git
    ```

2. **Build the Docker Container:** Navigate to the ALPHA-OS directory and build the Docker container using the provided Dockerfile.

    ```bash
    cd alpha-os
    docker build -t alpha-os .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:** Once the Docker container is built, you can run it using the following command. Replace `your-port` with the desired port number for accessing the container.

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p your-port:80 alpha-os
    ```

4. **Test and Deploy:** Access the ALPHA-OS environment by navigating to `http:ocalhost:your-port` in your web browser. You can now test and deploy applications on top of ALPHA-OS to create innovative prosthetic solutions.

5. **Develop Applications:** Develop and deploy applications on top of ALPHA-OS to create innovative prosthetic solutions tailored to the unique needs and requirements of users with limb loss or impairment.
